    // to spin up and longer to stop, which is the whole visual signature of weight. An oak door and a
    // cardboard one of the same size swing quite differently.
    //
    // But the correction has to be ANISOTROPIC, and the first attempt at this was not — it scaled the
    // whole tensor by 2.5, and that is where the syrupy, stiff feel came from.
    //
    // Inertia goes as the square of the radius, so the error in these capsules is not spread evenly:
    //   - About the limb's own LONG axis (a shin barrel-rolling about itself) inertia is governed almost
    //     entirely by the radius. Ours is 35mm where a real shin is nearer 60mm — an underestimate of
    //     roughly threefold. A capsule is very nearly a line about this axis, so it barrel-rolls for
    //     almost nothing: exactly the twitchiness that reads as weightless.
    //   - About the TRANSVERSE axes (the shin swinging end-over-end about the knee) inertia is dominated
    //     by the limb's LENGTH, which the model gets right. That number was already close to correct.
    //
    // Slowing the transverse axes by 2.5 therefore did not add weight; it added treacle, and it did it
    // on precisely the swings a body's weight is read from. Fix the axis that is wrong and leave the one

    // contact springs and a recovery-velocity cap, which the ground contacts hold at 2 m/s so the rig
    // can settle at all.)

    // What a fighting game does instead is stage the landing:
    //   1. a freeze — the corpse stops dead for a few dozen milliseconds,

    //   3. on a genuinely hard blow, and only then, a heave that folds the body about its hips,
    //   4. a camera shake, so the impact is felt outside the body as well.

    // 20-55ms band by no coincidence at all. It is the cheapest possible model of the one thing this
    // engine genuinely cannot do.

    // chest are what arrive, while the feet have been on the floor the whole way down. Averaging the

/// Gravity and damping.
///
/// The damping here is a numerical crutch — it exists to bleed energy out of a solver that might
/// otherwise diverge — and applying it flat turned out to be the single biggest reason the ragdoll reads
/// weightless. At the configured 0.97 per 60Hz frame it takes 84% of a body's speed away every second,
/// which pins terminal velocity at
///
///     v = g·dt·d / (1 − d)  ≈  9.8/60 × 0.97/0.03  ≈  5.3 m/s
///
/// A person who falls 1.4 m is already past that. So nothing in this rig has ever been able to fall
/// faster than a brisk walk — every corpse has been sinking through syrup, and the whip a limb should
/// have on impact was drained out of it before it landed. It also explains why raising mass never
/// helped: mass cancels out of free fall entirely (Galileo), and out of the joint forces too, so
/// scaling the whole rig changes nothing at all about how it moves.
///
/// The fix is to charge the crutch only where it is needed. A body that is settling keeps the full
/// damping — every bit of the settle and collapse tuning behaves exactly as before, because below the
/// settle threshold this is bit-for-bit the old code — while a body that is falling keeps almost none
/// of it and accelerates the way it should. A little always survives, so a solver that does start to
/// diverge still bleeds energy rather than parking on the velocity clamp.
